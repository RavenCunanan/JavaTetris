A Tetris Clone made in Java by Raven Cunanan

To run the program just run Main.java on your preferred development platform.

Description:

This Java-based Tetris clone features an adaptive difficulty system where the game speeds up every five lines cleared. 

Tetris challenges players to fit falling blocks together to form complete lines, clearing them to prevent the stack from reaching the top. The goal is to achieve high scores by clearing lines and managing the increasing speed as the game progresses.

The controls are straightforward:

Arrow Keys (Down, Left, Right): Move blocks.
A, S, D: Alternative keys for block movement.
Arrow Key Up or W : Rotate blocks clockwise.
Z or P: Rotate blocks counter-clockwise.
Escape: Pause the game.


Experience the classic Tetris gameplay with a dynamic challenge that progressively increases in difficulty. Test your skills and adaptability in this Java Tetris clone as you strive to clear lines and reach higher levels amidst the accelerating pace.
